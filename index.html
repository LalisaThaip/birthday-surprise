  <h1>Happy Birthday Lover Boy</h1>
  <p>
    I wish you the finest of birthdays my trouble maker. 
    I love you more than words can say
    and more than code can compile. I hope this little
    surprise makes your birthday extra special, just like you are to me.
    I hope this year brings you success with all your
    pursuits, whether in studies, career, or personal growth (You got relationships covered).
    May you be surrounded by the things that make life worth living, and make time for yourself to find joy in the little things.
    I am lucky to have you in my life and I hope you know how much you mean to me.
    <br><br>I know it is your birthday, but I am the one wishing we can celebrate more birthdays together in the future. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Happy 24th, Alex. <br><br>
    With much love, <br>
    Lisa the berry cat
